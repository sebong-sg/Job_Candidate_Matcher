GitHub Workflow Guide

✅ Branching
- Create dev branch: git checkout -b dev
- Push dev branch: git push -u origin dev

✅ Protection Rules
- Go to Settings → Branches → Add Ruleset
- Target: main
- Enable: pull request, approvals, signed commits, linear history, restrict force pushes/deletions

✅ Commit & Push
- Stage: git add .
- Commit: git commit -m "Add analytics engine and web interface"
- Push: git push

✅ Pull Request
- Compare dev → main
- Use PR template
- Merge via squash or rebase

If the new file is untracked—you haven’t staged it yet.

✅ How to Fix It
🔧 Step 1: Stage the New File
Run:
git add GITHUB_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.txt

Or to stage everything (recommended if you're ready):
git add .
Step 2: Commit Again
Now that the file is staged, commit it:
git commit -m "Add GitHub workflow guide documentation"

🔧 Step 3: Push to GitHub
git push


New file will now appear in the dev branch on GitHub.




🧭 1. Local vs Remote Branches
You may have created branches locally in Codespaces but haven’t pushed them to GitHub yet.
✅ Fix:
In your Codespaces terminal, run:
git branch         # shows local branches
git branch -r      # shows remote branches

To push a local branch to GitHub:
git push -u origin your-branch-name

📁 2. Uncommitted or Unpushed Files
Files created in Codespaces won’t appear on GitHub unless they’re:
- Committed to Git
- Pushed to a remote branch
✅ Fix:
git add .
git commit -m "Add new files"
git push

🔍 3. Wrong Branch Selected on GitHub
On GitHub.com, you might be viewing the main branch while your changes are in dev or another branch.
✅ Fix:
- Go to your repo
- Use the branch dropdown (top-left above the file list)
- Switch to the correct branch (e.g., dev, feature/login-module)

🧼 4. Files Ignored by .gitignore
Some files (e.g., .env, logs, temp files) may be excluded from Git tracking.
✅ Fix:
Check your .gitignore file in Codespaces. If needed, remove the file from .gitignore and re-add it:
git add yourfile
git commit -m "Track previously ignored file"
git push

🧠 5. Detached HEAD or Workspace Misalignment
If you’re in a detached HEAD state or working outside the repo folder, Git may not track your changes.
✅ Fix:
Make sure you’re inside the correct repo folder
pwd
git status

If needed, switch to a valid branch:
git checkout main

🧭 Step-by-Step: Ensure Your Branches and Files Are Visible on GitHub
✅ 1. Check Remote Branches
Run:
git branch -r
This shows branches that exist on GitHub (remote). You should see:
origin/main
origin/dev

If origin/dev is missing, push it:
git push -u origin dev

✅ 2. Check File Status
Run:
git status

git status
``>
If you see untracked or modified files, they haven’t been committed yet.

To commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add files for dev branch"
git push

Thanks for sharing that, Seb. This confirms you're currently on the dev branch, and you also have a local main branch. However, this only shows local branches—not whether your changes, branches, or files have been pushed to GitHub or are visible there.
Let’s walk through a quick diagnostic and fix:

🧭 Step-by-Step: Ensure Your Branches and Files Are Visible on GitHub
✅ 1. Check Remote Branches
Run:
git branch -r


This shows branches that exist on GitHub (remote). You should see:
origin/main
origin/dev


If origin/dev is missing, push it:
git push -u origin dev



✅ 2. Check File Status
Run:
git status
``>
If you see untracked or modified files, they haven’t been committed yet.

To commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add files for dev branch"
git push



✅ 3. Confirm on GitHub
Go to github.com/sebong-sg/Job_Candidate_Matcher
- Use the branch dropdown (top-left above the file list)
- Switch to dev or any other branch
- Confirm your files appear

🧠 Optional: View All Branches and Their Status
Run:
git remote show origin

This shows which branches are tracked, pushed, and synced.


If encountering a classic Git sync issue, or a mismatch between your local dev branch and the remote dev branch on GitHub. Here's exactly what's happening and how to fix it safely:

🧠 What the Error Means
Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.

This means someone (possibly you from another device or Codespace) pushed new commits to dev on GitHub, and your local copy doesn’t have those changes yet. Git is blocking your push to prevent overwriting them.

✅ How to Fix It Safely
🔧 Step 1: Pull Remote Changes First
Run this in your terminal:
git pull --rebase


This pulls the latest commits from GitHub and replays your local commits on top, keeping history clean.


🔧 Step 2: Push Again
Once the rebase completes successfully:
git push


Your new commit (including GITHUB_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.txt) will now be pushed to GitHub.

🧭 Why This Happens
- You may have made changes in another Codespace or GitHub.com (e.g., editing README.md).
- Git wants to merge or rebase those changes before allowing your push.

Would you like help visualizing this sync flow in a storyboard or setting up GitHub Actions to auto-check for remote changes before pushing? I can also help you configure git pull --rebase as your default behavior for cleaner workflows.
