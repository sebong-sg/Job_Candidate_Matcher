GitHub Workflow Guide

✅ Branching
- Create dev branch: git checkout -b dev
- Push dev branch: git push -u origin dev

✅ Protection Rules
- Go to Settings → Branches → Add Ruleset
- Target: main
- Enable: pull request, approvals, signed commits, linear history, restrict force pushes/deletions

✅ Commit & Push
- Stage: git add .
- Commit: git commit -m "Add analytics engine and web interface"
- Push: git push

✅ Pull Request
- Compare dev → main
- Use PR template
- Merge via squash or rebase

If the new file is untracked—you haven’t staged it yet.

✅ How to Fix It
🔧 Step 1: Stage the New File
Run:
git add GITHUB_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.txt

Or to stage everything (recommended if you're ready):
git add .
Step 2: Commit Again
Now that the file is staged, commit it:
git commit -m "Add GitHub workflow guide documentation"

🔧 Step 3: Push to GitHub
git push


New file will now appear in the dev branch on GitHub.




🧭 1. Local vs Remote Branches
You may have created branches locally in Codespaces but haven’t pushed them to GitHub yet.
✅ Fix:
In your Codespaces terminal, run:
git branch         # shows local branches
git branch -r      # shows remote branches

To push a local branch to GitHub:
git push -u origin your-branch-name

📁 2. Uncommitted or Unpushed Files
Files created in Codespaces won’t appear on GitHub unless they’re:
- Committed to Git
- Pushed to a remote branch
✅ Fix:
git add .
git commit -m "Add new files"
git push

🔍 3. Wrong Branch Selected on GitHub
On GitHub.com, you might be viewing the main branch while your changes are in dev or another branch.
✅ Fix:
- Go to your repo
- Use the branch dropdown (top-left above the file list)
- Switch to the correct branch (e.g., dev, feature/login-module)

🧼 4. Files Ignored by .gitignore
Some files (e.g., .env, logs, temp files) may be excluded from Git tracking.
✅ Fix:
Check your .gitignore file in Codespaces. If needed, remove the file from .gitignore and re-add it:
git add yourfile
git commit -m "Track previously ignored file"
git push

🧠 5. Detached HEAD or Workspace Misalignment
If you’re in a detached HEAD state or working outside the repo folder, Git may not track your changes.
✅ Fix:
Make sure you’re inside the correct repo folder
pwd
git status

If needed, switch to a valid branch:
git checkout main

🧭 Step-by-Step: Ensure Your Branches and Files Are Visible on GitHub
✅ 1. Check Remote Branches
Run:
git branch -r
This shows branches that exist on GitHub (remote). You should see:
origin/main
origin/dev

If origin/dev is missing, push it:
git push -u origin dev

✅ 2. Check File Status
Run:
git status

git status
``>
If you see untracked or modified files, they haven’t been committed yet.

To commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add files for dev branch"
git push

Thanks for sharing that, Seb. This confirms you're currently on the dev branch, and you also have a local main branch. However, this only shows local branches—not whether your changes, branches, or files have been pushed to GitHub or are visible there.
Let’s walk through a quick diagnostic and fix:

🧭 Step-by-Step: Ensure Your Branches and Files Are Visible on GitHub
✅ 1. Check Remote Branches
Run:
git branch -r


This shows branches that exist on GitHub (remote). You should see:
origin/main
origin/dev


If origin/dev is missing, push it:
git push -u origin dev



✅ 2. Check File Status
Run:
git status
``>
If you see untracked or modified files, they haven’t been committed yet.

To commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add files for dev branch"
git push



✅ 3. Confirm on GitHub
Go to github.com/sebong-sg/Job_Candidate_Matcher
- Use the branch dropdown (top-left above the file list)
- Switch to dev or any other branch
- Confirm your files appear

🧠 Optional: View All Branches and Their Status
Run:
git remote show origin

This shows which branches are tracked, pushed, and synced.
