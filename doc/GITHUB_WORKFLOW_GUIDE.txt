Title: Git Workflow Guide — Staging and Committing Modified + Untracked Files
Last Updated: 11 October 2025
Purpose: This guide outlines a disciplined Git workflow for safely staging and committing both modified (M) and untracked (??) files in GitHub Codespaces or local development environments.

---
🧭 Step 1: Check File Status
----------------------------
Run:
    git status

You’ll see:
- M for modified files (e.g., web_app.py)
- ?? for untracked files (e.g., new_module.py)
---

📦 Step 2: Stage Files for Commit
---------------------------------
Option A: Stage Specific Files
    git add web_app.py new_module.py

Option B: Stage All Changes
    git add .

Note: This adds all modified and untracked files, excluding those listed in .gitignore.

---

📝 Step 3: Commit with a Clear Message
------------------------------------------------------
    git commit -m "Update web_app.py and add new_module.py"

Tip: Use descriptive, governance-friendly messages. Include module tags or versioning if needed.

---

🚀 Step 4: Push to GitHub
-------------------------
    git push

This syncs your committed changes to the remote branch (e.g., dev).

---

🧠 Optional Checks Before Committing
-----------------------------------

Preview Staged Changes:
    git diff --staged

Review What’s Being Tracked:
    git status

---

🛡️ Best Practices
-----------------

- Use .gitignore to exclude temp files or sensitive assets
- Always commit before closing Codespaces to avoid data loss
- Consider aliases for frequent tasks (e.g., git stage-all, git update)
- Use modular commit messages for traceability (e.g., [frontend] Update web_app.py)

Title: GitHub Workflow Guide — Branching, Protection, Commit Discipline, and PR Governance
Last Updated: 11 October 2025  
Purpose: This guide outlines a disciplined GitHub workflow for managing branches, enforcing protection rules, committing changes, and executing pull requests with governance best practices.

---

✅ Branching Strategy
---------------------

Create a feature or development branch from main:
    git checkout -b dev

Push the new branch to GitHub and set upstream tracking:
    git push -u origin dev

Tip: Use descriptive branch names for clarity (e.g., dev-frontend-ui or feature/resume-matcher).

---

✅ Protection Rules (Main Branch Governance)
-------------------------------------------

To enforce governance on the `main` branch:

1. Navigate to:
    GitHub Repo → Settings → Branches → Add Ruleset

2. Target Branch:
    main

3. Enable the following rules:
    - Require pull request before merging
    - Require approvals (e.g., minimum 1 reviewer)
    - Require signed commits
    - Enforce linear history (no merge commits)
    - Restrict force pushes and branch deletions

Tip: These rules ensure traceability, auditability, and protection of production-grade code.

---

✅ Commit & Push Discipline
---------------------------

Stage all changes:
    git add .

Commit with a clear, modular message:
    git commit -m "Add analytics engine and web interface"

Push to the current branch:
    git push

Best Practices:
- Use semantic commit messages (e.g., feat:, fix:, chore:)
- Include module tags or versioning if applicable
- Avoid committing sensitive or temporary files—use .gitignore

---

✅ Pull Request Governance
--------------------------

Create a pull request to merge changes from `dev` into `main`:

1. Navigate to GitHub → Pull Requests → New Pull Request  
2. Compare:
    base: main  
    compare: dev

3. Use the PR template (if available) to document:
    - Purpose of change  
    - Scope of impact  
    - Testing and validation steps

4. Merge Strategy:
    - Prefer **Squash** or **Rebase** to maintain linear history
    - Avoid merge commits unless explicitly required

Tip: Tag reviewers and link related issues for traceability.

---
✅ How to Create a Pull Request from feature/semantic-scoring → dev
🔹 Step 1: Set the Branches
At the top of the screen, you’ll see two dropdowns:
- Base: This should be dev (the branch you want to merge into)
- Compare: This should be feature/semantic-scoring (your working branch)
If they’re reversed, click the “swap” icon between them to flip.


🔹 Step 2: Review the Diff
GitHub will show you:
- All the files changed
- Line-by-line diffs
- Additions in green, deletions in red
This helps you verify what’s being merged.

🔹 Step 3: Click the Green “Create Pull Request” Button
Once you’re happy with the changes:
- Click “Create pull request”
- Add a clear title (e.g., Add semantic scoring engine)
- Write a description:
- What was added
- How it was tested
- Any known issues or next steps

🔹 Step 4: Choose Merge Strategy (after PR is created)
Once the PR is open:
- Scroll to the bottom
- Click the small dropdown next to the green “Merge pull request” button
- Choose:
- ✅ Squash and merge (recommended)
- 🔄 Rebase and merge
- 🌳 Merge commit


----

🛡️ Governance Notes
--------------------

- Always commit before closing Codespaces to avoid data loss
- Use branch naming conventions for clarity and automation
- Document major changes in README or CHANGELOG
- Protect IP and sensitive logic with modular folder structure and access control

GITHUB_SYNC_DIAGNOSTIC_GUIDE.txt
=================================

Title: GitHub Sync Diagnostic & Recovery Guide  
Last Updated: 11 October 2025  
Purpose: This guide helps diagnose and resolve common sync issues between your local Codespaces environment and your GitHub repository. It ensures that branches, files, and commits are properly tracked, pushed, and visible on GitHub.

---

🧭 SECTION 1: Local vs Remote Branches
--------------------------------------

Problem:
You may have created branches locally in Codespaces but haven’t pushed them to GitHub yet.

Diagnosis:
Run:
    git branch         # shows local branches
    git branch -r      # shows remote branches

Fix:
To push a local branch to GitHub:
    git push -u origin your-branch-name

---

📁 SECTION 2: Uncommitted or Unpushed Files
-------------------------------------------

Problem:
Files created in Codespaces won’t appear on GitHub unless they’re:
- Committed to Git
- Pushed to a remote branch

Fix:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new files"
    git push

Tip: Always commit before closing Codespaces to avoid data loss.

---

🔍 SECTION 3: Wrong Branch Selected on GitHub
---------------------------------------------

Problem:
You’re viewing the `main` branch on GitHub.com, but your changes are in `dev` or another branch.

Fix:
- Go to your GitHub repo
- Use the branch dropdown (top-left above the file list)
- Switch to the correct branch (e.g., `dev`, `feature/login-module`)

---

🧼 SECTION 4: Files Ignored by .gitignore
-----------------------------------------

Problem:
Some files (e.g., `.env`, logs, temp files) may be excluded from Git tracking.

Fix:
- Check your `.gitignore` file in Codespaces
- If needed, remove the file from `.gitignore`
- Then re-add and commit:
    git add yourfile
    git commit -m "Track previously ignored file"
    git push

---

🧠 SECTION 5: Detached HEAD or Workspace Misalignment
------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
You’re in a detached HEAD state or working outside the repo folder, so Git isn’t tracking your changes.

Fix:
- Confirm your location:
    pwd
    git status

- If needed, switch to a valid branch:
    git checkout main

---

🧭 SECTION 6: Step-by-Step Sync Checklist
-----------------------------------------

✅ 1. Check Remote Branches
Run:
    git branch -r

Expected Output:
    origin/main  
    origin/dev

If `origin/dev` is missing:
    git push -u origin dev

✅ 2. Check File Status
Run:
    git status

If you see untracked or modified files:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add files for dev branch"
    git push

✅ 3. Confirm on GitHub
- Go to: github.com/sebong-sg/Job_Candidate_Matcher
- Use the branch dropdown
- Switch to `dev` or your working branch
- Confirm your files appear

✅ 4. View All Branches and Their Status
Run:
    git remote show origin

This shows which branches are tracked, pushed, and synced.

---

🧠 SECTION 7: Resolving Git Sync Conflicts
------------------------------------------

Problem:
You see this error when pushing:
> Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.

Explanation:
Someone (possibly you from another device or Codespace) pushed new commits to `dev` on GitHub. Your local copy doesn’t have those changes yet. Git blocks your push to prevent overwriting.

Fix:

🔧 Step 1: Pull Remote Changes First
    git pull --rebase

This pulls the latest commits and replays your local commits on top, preserving clean history.

🔧 Step 2: Push Again
    git push

Your new commit (e.g., `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.txt`) will now be pushed safely.

---

🧭 Why This Guide Matters
--------------------------

This workflow ensures:
- Your branches are properly tracked and visible on GitHub
- Your files are committed and pushed before Codespaces closes
- You avoid common Git sync errors and maintain clean commit history
- You follow governance-friendly practices for traceability and collaboration
